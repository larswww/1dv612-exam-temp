The application is supposed to work as a notification hub and dashboard for a user's github organizations. In the application the user should be able to list and select his/her organizations as well as receive notifications, for example, the latest releases, latest commits etc. for repos in the selected organization.
The application should be able to notify the user about certain events that occur in the various organizations even if the user is not running the application. This could for instance be solved using notifications sent to slack, facebook messenger, browser notifications or sms. Other alternatives could be discussed. The user should inside of the application be able to configure which organizations events will be sent as notifications in this way. +

The user should be able to close the application and return at a later date. If so, the application should be able to show information that is new since the last execution.
